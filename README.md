# Astonish.js
A light and simple framework to reveal animations from the animate.css library.

This can be used in any project commercial or otherwise without any attribution/credit necessary.
In order to set this up, make sure you add a 'data-animation' along with the astonish class to any element you wish to animate. Optionally, you can also add a 'data-delay' and a 'data-duration'.
